# Goal

**Don't be fail in coding test anymore in 2020.**



# Algorithm

**Do learn algorithm concept** 

* `theory` : summarized by mark down.
* `problems` : problem solved by c++.

> `Simulation` : [Basic](https://github.com/minje46/Algorithm_Solving/blob/master/00.Simulation/1021_circular_queue.cpp "basic")

# Problem_Solving

**Solve the bunch of algorithm problems.**

- Some problems on each level (step by step)
- Each numbered problems of  diverse algorithm.

# Goal

**Solve the algorithm problem everyday at least one since 2019.**

**Get A+ score on SW Expert test.**

# Special problems

**These problems were so hard to solve or it was handled with special(new) concept of algorithm.**
